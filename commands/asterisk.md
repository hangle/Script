<h1>Asterisk Command</h1>

<p>The Asterisk command with the tag *, and mandatory space, provides specialized tasks. These tasks <br />
are only applied to settings and conditions within the current .nc script file. Their effects do not <br />
extend to .nc script file to which the current file is linked via the File command. For example, <br />
the asterisk command ' * bold ' overrides the default font-- normal, for the current .nc file.  </p>

<p>The task name follows the * tag. In most cases, one or more spaces follow, along with a value.   </p>

<pre>
        end                   <no value>
        continue              <no value>
        noprior               <no value>
        nomanage              <no value>
        manage                < filename string>
        save                  < filename string>
        height                300
        width                 400
        size                  14
        color                 black
        name                  TimesRoman
        style                 normal
        length                10
        limit                 99
</pre>

<hr />

<p>. * end   (Asterisk Command)  </p>

<hr />

<p>Ends the session and terminates the program. The end asterisk command is typically <br />
the last command of the .nc file. If not present to terminate the session, then the <br />
program loops and executes the first Card Set.    </p>

<p>The End asterisk command is not a member of the Card Set. It is either executed prior <br />
to or following a Card Set. When present within a card set, then the end termination <br />
does not occur until the Card Set is completed.  </p>

<hr />

<p>. * continue   (Asterisk Command)    </p>

<hr />

<p>Halts the execution of the Card Set and arms the NEXT button. When the NEXT button <br />
is activated, the execution of the Card Set continues.  </p>

<p>This command is useful so as to not overload the user with too much text material <br />
to start. It allows part of the information to be presented, and then followed up <br />
by supplemental or qualifying details.  </p>

<p>The * continue asterisk command is typically used with Card Sets lacking input fields. <br />
The following script has both response capture and the * continue command:  </p>

<pre><code>    c  
    d (# $input)  
    * continue  
    d following text.
</code></pre>

<p>The above script will not work.  The field does not gain focus until the * continue
and d following text commands have executed.  The function of the eXecute command <br />
halt the processing of commands to allow response capture.  </p>

<pre><code>    c   
    d (# $input)   
    x   
    d following text.
</code></pre>

<p>The above script may safely employ an * continue command:  </p>

<pre><code>    c  
    d (# $input)  
    x  
    d following text.  
    * continue  
    d display after continue command
</code></pre>

<p>It works because following the eXecute command there are no input fields.  </p>

<hr />

<p>. * noprior   (Asterisk Command)    </p>

<hr />

<p>Disables the PRIOR or backup button.  </p>

<hr />

<p>. * nomanage   (Asterisk Command)  </p>

<hr />

<p>Disables the * or Manage File button.  </p>

<hr />

<p>. * manage   (Asterisk Command)  </p>

<hr />

<p>Specifies a '.nc' filename. When the '* button is activated, then execution transfers <br />
from the Card Set of the 'current ' file to the first Card Set of the .nc file.  </p>

<p>From any Card Set of the .nc file, activation of the '*' button returns execution <br />
to the 'current' file and to the Card Set from which the initial transfer originated.  </p>

<p>The management file feature is useful in survey type applications where a survey, <br />
for example, is interrupted. The reason for interruption is recorded in the <br />
management file along with the survey point of interruption.    </p>

<hr />

<p>.* save   (Asterisk Command)  </p>

<hr />

<p>Specifies a filename to which the Notecard $<variable>s are written. The file <br />
consist of key/value pairs, one pair to a line. The key is the variable name and <br />
the value is the variable's content. The pair is tab separated.    </p>

<hr />

<p>. * height   (Asterisk Command)  </p>

<hr />

<p>Establishes the height of the Notecard window. The default window height is 300. <br />
The asterisk Boldcommand of window height is found at the beginning of the '.nc' <br />
file. It only changes the window setting for the duration of the '.nc' script file.  </p>

<hr />

<p>. * width   (Asterisk Command)  </p>

<hr />

<p>Establishes the width of the Notecard window. The default window width is 400. <br />
The asterisk command of window width is found at the beginning of the '.nc' file.    </p>

<hr />

<p>. * size (of lettering--Asterisk Command)    </p>

<hr />

<p>Establishes the lettering size of the lettering. The default size is 16.  </p>

<hr />

<p>. * color (of lettering-- Asterisk Command)  </p>

<hr />

<p>Establishes the lettering color. The default color is black.  </p>

<hr />

<p>. * name (Font-- Asterisk Command)  </p>

<hr />

<p>Establishes a particular font, such as:  </p>

<pre><code>    Serif  
    Loma  
    Dialog  
    Symbol
</code></pre>

<p>The default font name is TimesRoman. The list of font name is in fontName.txt.  </p>

<hr />

<p>. * style   (Asterisk Command)   </p>

<hr />

<p>Font style has three types (1) regular, (2) bold, and (3) italics. The values to <br />
establish these fonts are:  </p>

<pre><code>    bold  
    normal  
    italic
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>. * length   (Asterisk Command)   </p>

<hr />

<p>The * length asterisk command is only relevant to the system's response capture <br />
feature. In the script example: <br />
        d Enter age (# $age) <br />
The display command prints the text 'Enter age' and renders an input field of a <br />
given size. The default   size or length is 10. The * length command alters the <br />
field size. It does not limit the number of response characters that the user enters.  </p>

<hr />

<p>. * limit   (Asterisk Command)  </p>

<hr />

<p>The * limit asterisk command is only relevant to the system's response capture <br />
feature. When the user enters characters equal to this limit, then the input <br />
mechanism terminates. If the number of characters is less than the limit, then the <br />
ENTER key terminates the input. The default limit is 99.  </p>

<p>The user may delete input characters prior to reaching the limit. The deleted <br />
characters do not effect the character count towards the limit.  </p>

<h2>Test Directory (Script/src/test):  </h2>

<p>The execution of the script in the DEMO directory:  </p>

<pre><code>    scala card demo/card
</code></pre>

<p>reveals features of the Notecard capabilities.  However, it <br />
does not exercise the complete range of capabilities.  The <br />
DEMO directory just highlights the major Notecard features. <br />
For the user, it illustrates the potential of the Notecard <br />
system.  </p>

<p>The TEST directory contains script to exercises every <br />
feature of the system.  Its purpose is not a tutorial; <br />
rather, it is a means  to reveal or find errors and <br />
limitations in the script :code.   </p>

<p>It is expected that each script in the TEST directory <br />
will grow to exercise every combination of script elements <br />
in serarch of a failure, either leading to code correction <br />
or a controlled exception in the script program. For <br />
example, suppose a command begins with the letter 's' <br />
(not a valid command tag), then the Script program will <br />
print this invalid line and will indicate that the 's' is <br />
an invalid command tag. Or, execution of the Notecard <br />
program fails. In this case, the culprit may be the Script <br />
program for not detecting the code that caused the <br />
Notecard program to fail.   </p>

<p>The  focus of the TEST directory is to sresss the system. <br />
The TEST directory also serves as a regression test.   </p>

<p>To date, the following TEST scripts are available:   </p>

<pre><code>appearance.nc       
    Example:
        d 5/4/color red/Sorry wrong answer
        d now is (%%/color blue/for all good) men
groupCmd.nc
    Example:
        g (flag)=(true)
        ge
inputFields.nc
    Example:
        d Enter (# $name)
        d (# $one)  (# $two)  (# $three)
letterSize.nc       Note, component of appearance
    Example:
        d 5/4/size 20/Sorry wrong answer
        d now is (%%/size 10/for all good) men
loadDictionary.nc
    Example:
        l
        a $count=0
        a $flag=false
</code></pre>

<h2>Execution:</h2>

<p>Execution of the sript appearance.nc  must  be compiled in <br />
the Script/src directory:    </p>

<pre><code>    scala script test/appearance
</code></pre>

<p>The output file of the 'scala script text/appearance' is <br />
'appearance.struct'.  This file is executed in the Notecard <br />
src directory:</p>

<pre><code>    scala card test/appearance
</code></pre>

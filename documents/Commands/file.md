<h1>File Command</h1>

<p>The script of Notecard commands are in files with the '.nc' extension. The file <br />
command establishes a link between '.nc' files. The File command's tag is 'f', <br />
followed by one or more spaces, and then the name of the '.nc file it is linked <br />
to, for example:  </p>

<pre><code>    f myProgram
</code></pre>

<p>Note: the '.nc' extension is dropped.  </p>

<p>When the File command is encounter, then execution passes to the designated '.nc' <br />
file. In the above example, the first Card Set of 'myProgram.nc' is processed. <br />
In this linkage, when the file is not found, control passes to the Start window, <br />
where a Card Set will ask, via an input field,  for a '.nc' filename.  The <br />
Start window script is similar to the following:  </p>

<pre><code>    c  
    d Enter a filename (# $filename)  
    f $filename
</code></pre>

<p>The example illustrates that the File command my have a $\<variable\> whose value <br />
is treated as a filename.  The File command my have an optional Logic component <br />
that controls whether or not the command is executed. For example:  </p>

<pre><code>    f maleQuestions ($gender) = (male)  
    f femaleQuestions
</code></pre>

<p>In the above, if the client or student is not male, then then execution passes <br />
to the script in the femaleQuestions.nc file.  The logic component is involved <br />
and is described in the Logic Component page.  The File command is not a command <br />
member of the Card Set. It is placed following a Card Set. In many cases it is <br />
found at the end of a '.nc' file    </p>

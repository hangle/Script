AddCardSet
-------------

The following script creates a CardSet and a AddCardSet.      

		c
		d What is the capital of Ohio (# $columbus)

		+
		d Discover of the New World.

		* end

The CardSet, beginning with the command 'c', asks a question requiring a user   
response. The AddCardSet, beginning with the command '+', provides a probe or     
prompt, that is, a hint, for the user     

The question-CardSet arms the '+Add' button. Activation of the +Add button presents   
the AddCardSet along with its hint. Following the 'Next' button activation,   
the user is returned to the question-CardSet to complete the response.       

On the otherhand, the user can enter a response and activate the 'Next' button to   
skip the AddCardSet.     

The AddCardSet is always associated with the immediately preceding CardSet.  A   
CardSet may have more than one AddCardSet as the following script illustrates.   

		c
		d What is the capital of Ohio (# $columbus)

		+
		d Discover of the New World.

		+
		d Begins with 'C' and has 8 letters

		* end

Termination of the last AddCardSet initiates the return or re-display of the   
question-CardSet. A single AddCardSet is also the last in the series.  The series   
may be terminated before the last AddCardSet by activation of the '+Add' button.     
This button acts as a toggle switch to start and to terminate the series. The '+Add'     
button remains   highlighted until the last AddCardSet is    

Script Program:   

The CardSet and AddCardSet are identical in almost all respects. The differ by the    
'button' parameter that each has.    

		CardSet        button=0     No associated AddCardSet
		CardSet        button=1     Associated AddCardSet
		AddCardSet     button=2     Not last
		AddCardSet     button=99    Last AddCardSet

The top-level program 'script.scala' has two major program divisions:        
	
		ParserValidator   detects script errors    
		BuildStructure    creates linked list hiearchy    

		ParserValidator    
			CommandMaker 
				Tags 'c', 'b', or '+' invoke CardCommand
			CardCommand (CardSetCommand)
				Validates logic expression; invokes CardScript
			CardScript  (CardSetScript)
				Create "CardSet" and "AddCardSet"
		BuildStructure
			CommandLoader	
				Principle task to create objects, like CardSet,
				and pass these objects there parameters.
			CommandStructure
				Build linked list structure where Notecard
				is the ancestor of all classes.
			ModifyAddCardSet
				Set 'button' parameter.

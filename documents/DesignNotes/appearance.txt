Appearance Features 
=================

Appearance features cover the size, style, color, and font style of text.  It also   
includes the size and length of the input field, as well as the appearance features   
of input characters.  The number of input characters can be limited.  The window height   
and window width are Appearance features.  Activation and deactivation of the '*' and   
'PRIOR' buttons are included as Appearance features.   

The Appearance features are established by the default values of the program as   
listed below:  

<pre>
		 key           value

		height    	300		//window size argument
		width   	400		//window size argument
		name    	TimesRoman	// name of Font
		size       	14		// pixel size of lettering
		color     	black		// color of lettering
		style      	1		// 1=normal, 2=bold, 3=italics
		length    	10  		// input field length
		limit      	99		// limits the number of input characters 
		asteriskButton  on		//  "on" allows '* button' to be armed (active)
		priorButton     on 		//  "on" allow 'PRIOR button' to be armed (active)
</pre>

The script command file:

<pre>
		c 
		d now is the time for all good men
		* end
</pre>

The text of the 'd' command  is displayed in a window dimensioned as 300 x 400.  The   
text color is black.  Its size is 14, and its font style is TimesRoman.  

Ways to override default value.
-------------------------------

Asterisk Commands.   The '*' command  with an appearance key/value pair,  supercedes the   
corresponding program default value.  

The script command file:

<pre>
		* width 500
		* height 600
		* size 22
		c 
		d now is the time for all good men
		* end
</pre>

The window size changes to 500 x 600, and the text size becomes '22'.  The  text color   
is still black and the font size is still TimesRoman.  However, the introduction of the   
following '*' commands can change this.  

<pre>
		* color  green
		* name   Arial
</pre>

The '*' commands of the script file remains in effect until the next script file is executed.   

###The appearance.ini file.
The  'appearance.ini' file,  consisting of key/value pairs. These key/value pairs  change the    
default values for all script files in a session. The following is an example of an    
'appearance.ini' file.     

<pre>
			appearance.ini
		____________________________
		|    height 320
		|    width  260
		|    size     16
		|    color   green
</pre>

The file changes four default, appearance values.  These values become new default values   
overriding the program values.  They remain  in effect for the session's script files   
( the '* end' command terminates a session).  

The directory in which the Notecard program is executed is termed the 'home' directory.    
The 'appearance.ini' file in the 'home' directory is applied to the script files in 'home'   
directory and to all  script files in its subdirectories.  

An 'appearance.ini' directory within a 'home' subdirectory is applied to just the script   
files in that directory.   

In the event that 'appearance.ini' files are in both the 'home' directory and in a 'home'   
subdirectory, then the subdirectory 'ini' file supercedes the 'home' 'ini'  file, but   
only for script files in the subdirectory.  

The Appearance feature of an '*' command overrides a corresponding feature of the   
'appearance.ini' file.   For example, the following 'appearance.ini' file in the 'home'   
directory is:  

<pre>
			appearance.ini
		__________________
		|  size  12
</pre>

The initial default value of 14 is becomes 12 for all script files in the 'home' directory   
and its subdirectories.   

Next, an 'appeaance.ini' file in a subdirectory is:

<pre>
			appearance.ini
		____________________
		|  size 10
</pre>

The previous defaults letter size of 14 and 12 become 10 for just the script files in the   
subdirectory.  In the 'home' directory and its other subdirectories,  the default value   
is 12.  

Finally the following '*' command is added to a script file in the subdirectory whose   
'appearance.ini' file specifies a size is 10 :  

<pre>
		* size 22
</pre>

The default letter size is 22 for text in the script file having the '*' size 22 command.    
The other script files have a default letter size of 10.  

Two Types of '*' commands.
--------------------------

The '*'  Appearance commands, such as, '* size 22',  are not executed by the Notecard   
program.  The Notecard program executes the following '*' commands:  

<pre>
		* end
		* continue
		* save
		* manage <filename>
</pre>

The  '*'  Appearance commands are consumed in the Script program and are removed.

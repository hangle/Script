<h1>Script Program</h1>

<p>The 'notecard' program executes card-size windows that <br />
render text and/or capture user's responses. Logic can <br />
be applied to these responses to alter the flow of window <br />
presentation.  </p>

<p>The window material is rapidly built using eight command <br />
types organized in a script file.  The commands are <br />
validated by the 'script' program.  The 'script' output <br />
is a file with the extension '.struct'.  </p>

<h2>Run program:</h2>

<pre><code>scala card demo/card
</code></pre>

<p>(note:  the extension '.struct' of 'card.struct' is dropped"</p>
